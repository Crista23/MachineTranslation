Establish a good English window using evidence from several languages. Only then, find a corresponding source window.

for each target window w_e:
    good = True
    for each foreign language f:
        if there is no consistent foreign window w_f in the alignment-union-e-f:
           #NB union is lenient, but we could also use heuristic (intersection may be too rigid) - experiments?
           #Or intersection + one direction? 
           #Might also depend on the number of languages we use for reference..
           good = False
           break
        if good:
           find consistent source window w_f
           add phrase pair to phrase table

Check for each English window whether there exists a corresponding phrase in
